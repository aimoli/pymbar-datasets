Requires installing the uncertainties package ('pip install uncertainties')

- This package contains the input files and the Python scripts to
  perform MBAR calculations with data in different states
  (temperatures AND pressures) using the NPT ensemble. The molecular
  dynamics simulations were carried out using LAMMPS, in three
  different pressures (50, 70 and 90 MPa). For each pressure 16
  temperatures (ranging from 300 to 600 K) were considered, totaling
  48 independent simulations.

Package description:

- data.py: extracts data from LAMMPS log files (for pressures of 50,
  70 and 90 MPa) and creates the "empty" state files for pressures
  without samples (60 and 80 MPa). The number of states without
  samples where MBAR estimation is desired can be defined by changing
  the values of the variables "include_zeros" and "empty_Pstart", for
  temperatures and pressures respectively. In this example, two
  equally spaced new temperatures were included between each isobaric
  simulation and two new isobars (60 and 80 MPa) were estimated
  without any simulation performed in those pressures. The total
  number of studied states in this example (including those with
  samples) is 230.

- run_mbar_individual.py: performs MBAR calculation and dump the
  results (data files and plots) for different temperatures at each
  pressure alone. The reference values for methane in each pressure
  (obtained from NIST) were also included for the sake of comparison.

- run_mbar_all.py: performs MBAR calculation and dump the results
  (data files and plots) for all states analyzed at once (temperatures
  and pressures).

Although not displayed in the plots for simplicity, the uncertainties
in all properties were calculated using error propagation standard
formulas (using the Uncertainties Python package).
